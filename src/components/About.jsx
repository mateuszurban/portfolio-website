      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I am passionate about bridging the gap between technology and art. I
        believe that the best digital experiences emerge from the perfect blend
        of aesthetic design and innovative technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I blend soft skills with a collaborative spirit, remembering that
        continuous learning and effective communication are paramount for
        success. I aim to create things that feel natural to interact with,
        prioritising accessibility and inclusivity. My journey is fueled by an
        insatiable curiosity and a commitment to life-long learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my side projects, I prioritise the visual and strive to make
        interfaces as intuitive as possible. My goal is to create user
        experiences that are not only visually appealing but also seamless and
        user-friendly.
